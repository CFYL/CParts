		#autoLOC_CParts_0001 = China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation	// manufacturer
		#autoLOC_CParts_0002 = YF-3 Liquid Fuel Engine	// titles
		#autoLOC_CParts_0003 = An engine with fairly good space performance, recommended for using in the upper atmosphere.	// descriptions
		#autoLOC_CParts_0004 = LG-02 Solid Rocket Booster
		#autoLOC_CParts_0005 = This SRB is, strangely, aimed for vacuum purposes, perhaps as the final kick to get into orbit.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0006 = YF-2 Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_CParts_0007 = What happens when you don't have enough thrust on the first stage? Just duplicate the engine by 4 and we have this.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0008 = DFH-1
		#autoLOC_CParts_0009 = A quite heavy probe core to take to space, with our current state of rocket technology.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0010 = CZ-1 1st stage Tank
		#autoLOC_CParts_0011 = This tank is the longest one that our engineers can build right now. So it can be used to feed some really powerful enginea, such as the YF-2 cluster.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0012 = CZ-1 2nd stage Tank
		#autoLOC_CParts_0013 = This tank contains a certain amout of liquid fuel and oxidizer, and also includes a fairing to put the YF-3 engine inside.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0014 = CZ-1 Truss Stack Decoupler
		#autoLOC_CParts_0015 = This stack decoupler leaves some space for you to attach an engine to the fuel tank above it.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0016 = DFH-1 and CZ-1
		#autoLOC_CParts_0017 = The first Chinese spacecraft to ever reach orbit, launched on 1970/04/01.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0018 = YF-1 Liquid Fuel Engine
		#autoLOC_CParts_0019 = This engine gives you a very generous thrust, compared to its mass.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0020 = YF-2 Engine Mount
		#autoLOC_CParts_0021 = When you don't have enough thrust, use multiple engines.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0022 = CParts-100 Tank
		#autoLOC_CParts_0023 = CParts-100 Tank packs the same amount of propellants as an FL-T100. The blue belt will be there even if you think this tank is purely structural.
		#autoLOC_CParts_0024 = fueled	// variant name
		#autoLOC_CParts_0025 = structural	// variant name
