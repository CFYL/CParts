This is the CParts mod, introducing rocket parts based on the Chinese rocket CZ-1 (Long March 1). This mod is a scaled-down and stock-balanced version of the real rocket. The parts can also be used to fill in some gaps in the stock parts, or add a new appearance on your rocket.

Waterfall is a dependency. StockWaterfallEffects is not a hard dependency, but is strongly recommended.

Templates are copied from MOD StockWaterfallEffects but renamed.
EngineFX are copied from MOD StockWaterfallEffects with minor edits.
